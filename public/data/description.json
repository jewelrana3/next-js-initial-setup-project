    "description": "All of our 18k Gold and Rose Gold pieces are vermeil. Vermeil (pronounced ver-may) is a 18th century French jewelry technique which refers to the materials used as well as the plating method. The base is .925 solid Sterling Silver, with a thick layer of 18k Yellow Gold or Rose Gold. In order to be titled 'Vermeil', the gold must be over 10k and plated to be 2.5 microns (fives times thicker than normal plated jewelry). We also add a palladium layer to ensure the lasting of our plating."
